                    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web. It is a fundamental building block of web development, allowing developers to define the structure and elements of a web page. HTML is not a programming language; instead, it is a markup language that uses tags to describe different elements on a webpage.

                    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is responsible for styling and formatting web pages, controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It allows web developers to separate the structure and content of a webpage from its visual design, making it easier to maintain and update.

                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that plays a crucial role in web development. It enables developers to create dynamic and interactive content on the client side of web applications. Originally designed for web browsers, JavaScript is now widely used in various environments beyond the browser, including server-side development and mobile app development.

                    ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible  
                    JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
                    It is an open-source, component-based front-end  
                    library that is responsible only for the view layer  
                    of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it  
                    is just a library developed by Facebook to solve  
                    some problems that we were facing earlier.
